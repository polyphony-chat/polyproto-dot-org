Hi! We're glad you're interested in contributing to polyproto! We hope that this page succeeds
in giving you a good overview about what you can help with, and how you can help!

## Coding

So you'd like to code! That's fantastic, because no matter what language you program in, there's
something you can contribute to polyproto.

### Libraries

polyproto's "flagship" library is written in Rust. If you're interested in helping out by coding in
Rust, then the [polyproto-rs](https://github.com/polyphony-chat/polyproto-rs) crate is an obvious
choice for that. Here are a bunch of things you can start with:

- Look at the issues tab! Do you see anything that is interesting to you? If the issue isn't
  already assigned to someone, feel free to leave a comment requesting more information, or
  notifying us that you intend to work on this issue, so that we can avoid duplicate work and
  support you as best as we can!
- Check out the `examples` directory! The more, the merrier! Providing examples for other coders is
  invaluable work and can give you a deeper understanding of how the library works at its core at
  the same time!
- Check out the
  [coverage report](https://coveralls.io/github/polyphony-chat/polyproto-rs?branch=main) and write
  tests for parts of the code that aren't yet covered by tests! The tests you write should make
  sense, of course. Coverage alone is not a valuable metric. Do not hesitate to ask through an
  issue, through our Discord or via IRC, if you have any questions whatsoever!

All of the above apply to any piece of code that is maintained by the polyphony-chat organization.

### Non-Rust related things

We think that Rust is great, but we also understand that it isn't for everyone, and that it has
quite the learning curve. Luckily, all languages are great in their own regard.

Having a flagship crate that is written in Rust is great and all, but if you are a Python,
TypeScript, C++, Java, C# or \<insert language\> developer, you can't really do anything with that
Rust crate.

If you are not a Rust developer but _a_ developer, you can always start your own polyproto library
project in the language you love most! Again, please feel absolutely free to reach out to us and ask
as many questions as you'd like. We'd love to support you in your effort as much as we can! Making
polyproto available in multiple languages is an amazing idea and an effort that is always welcomed.

## Writing

If you are not a coder, but a human nonetheless (or a robot, or some sort of sentient animal!), you
can always skim the things we wrote (including this very guide) and refine unclear or redundant
areas, or perfect passages that are written less eloquently than you'd like. :heart:
