The polyproto association should make efforts to foster, unify and certify "official" extensions and standards that all developers should use. I am not 100% sure about what this would look like; Imagine, someone develops a p2-extension defining what a Google Photos-like should look like. This person now comes to the polyproto association with a wish to get a "seal of approval" via getting their extension certified. The association members notice, that this extension is pretty awesome. What happens now? Should this extension be "absorbed" into the association somehow? Should only this exact version of the extension receive certification, requiring the developer to contact the association again if an update to the extension is made, to get the updated version certified as well? And if this is the case, say there happens to be a disagreement between the association and the developer on the contents of the extension update \u2013 what then? Does the association eventually "hard fork" the extension? This seems very complex, and I think that cases like these should be considered, given that sadly not every human being gets along with each other.
