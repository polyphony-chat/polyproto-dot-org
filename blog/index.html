<p>Polyphony and polyproto are, at the moment, &quot;just hobbies&quot; for me. However, I <em>do</em> still really want
this all to succeed long-term. These wishes do involve a lot of planning ahead, including thinking
about passing on the torch, so that this fire does not die with me. A pretty uncommon thing to say
about a hobby, I think.</p>
<p>It is pretty clear to me that I do not want to be the sole ruler of all things polyproto. I simply
don&#x27;t have the time, energy and skills to manage everything myself, should polyproto really become
something that is used by a larger audience. polyproto must be an open standard, and in my opinion,
to make a standard truly open is to eventually let go and involve other people in decision making
processes. This is what I have been thinking about a lot lately, and I wanted to use this article as
a space to share my thoughts and wishes for the future.</p>

<p>To make a long story short, I believe that establishing a non-profit foundation or association that
concerns itself with governing and developing polyproto is <em>the</em> way to go. The tasks of such an
association would be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coordinating and overseeing work on the protocol:</strong> As the polyproto sees increased usage,
changes and additions to the core protocol will most definitely need to be made to align the
protocol with real-world needs and wants voiced by users and developers alike. The polyproto
association would have the final say over what changes will be included in the next version of
polyproto by reviewing, commenting on and accepting/rejecting change proposals submitted by
people/groups.</li>
<li><strong>Foster a collaborative environment:</strong> I believe it would really <em>suck</em> if there were 12
(exaggeration) different p2-extensions defining what a Discord-like chat application should look
like. The polyproto association should make efforts to foster, unify and certify &quot;official&quot;
extensions and standards that all developers should use. I am not 100% sure about what this would
look like; Imagine, someone develops a p2-extension defining what a Google Photos-like should look
like. This person now comes to the polyproto association with a wish to get a &quot;seal of approval&quot;
via getting their extension certified. The association members notice, that this extension is
pretty awesome. What happens now? Should this extension be &quot;absorbed&quot; into the association
somehow? Should only this exact version of the extension receive certification, requiring the
developer to contact the association again if an update to the extension is made, to get the
updated version certified as well? And if this is the case, say there happens to be a disagreement
between the association and the developer on the contents of the extension update – what then?
Does the association eventually &quot;hard fork&quot; the extension? This seems very complex, and I think
that cases like these should be considered, given that sadly not every human being gets along with
each other. In any case, the polyproto association should make the process of getting your
extension proposal reviewed and seen by other people easier, so that extensions are not created in
a vacuum, but through <em>collaboration</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Act as a giant documentation resource:</strong> The association should be a great source of information
for interested developers. Documentation and explanations of concepts should be available in
various levels of complexity and should always be up-to-date.</li>
</ul>

<p>The time for something like this has not yet arrived. What this project needs in its infancy is
rapid development and the freedom to change a great number of things quickly.</p>
<p>What I need <em>right now</em> though is to get healthy again. As I am writing this, the flu is still doing
a number on me. Bleh.</p>

<p>polyproto is a new federation protocol with the goal of offering account portability and an
effortless experience for users and developers alike. It is part of the Polyphony Project, which
aims to be a truly competitive alternative to centralized, proprietary chat services like Discord.
We came up with the idea for polyproto because of a lingering frustration with current federation
protocols and their sub-optimal suitability for such a project.</p>
<p>polyproto is not limited to an application in a chat service, and that it is not incompatible with
federation protocols such as ActivityPub. It would technically be possible to write a polyproto +
ActivityPub server and client to offer new possibilities to the currently existing Fediverse. We
want to empower users, not split userbases further.</p>
<p>Our goal is to deliver the Polyphony chat service with polyproto at its core, build great SDKs for
other developers to work with, and to also directly work together with other developers to get
alternative implementations of polyproto-based chat services for users to choose from. Polyphony
should be the ideal, federated and decentralized Discord replacement; a service, that can be used by
teenagers, the elderly and anyone in between and which ideally does not require any additional
technical knowledge or proficiency to use.</p>

<p>I (Flori Weber, bitfl0wer) have been following the Spacebar-Chat (formerly &quot;Fosscord&quot;) project for
some time before deciding to start the Polyphony-Chat GitHub organization in March 2023. The
contributions I have made to the Spacebar project were limited to additions and overhauls of the
projects documentation, because of a lack of TypeScript knowledge, which is the programming language
primarily used in the Spacebar organization. Of course, I have prior experience in software
development and software design through my work at Deutsche Telekom MMS GmbH, but this is my first
project with such a topic. I am part of a software development community called &quot;Commune&quot;, which is
a home for individuals and groups who also have interest in federated and/or decentralized social
media, as well as &quot;reclaiming&quot; the web from the hands of large corporations. There, I have access to
like-minded individuals who are also very much interested in polyproto and in seeing polyproto
succeed.</p>

<p>There are three key things that I (Flori Weber, bitfl0wer) have been wanting to tackle for months
now, but have never been able to do, because of a lack of available personal time or expertise.
These three things are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Writing new material and, if necessary, reworking existing material that
<ul>
<li>Describes, in a condensed form, what polyproto is about, targeted towards people who do not
have [a lot of] existing knowledge in the topics of federation and decentralized social
networking concepts ($250-400)</li>
<li>Describes, in a condensed form, how polyproto works, targeted towards developers who might be
interested in learning more about the inner workings of polyproto, without needing to read the
entire protocol specification document ($250-400)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Starting to build some sort of &quot;brand&quot; by
<ul>
<li>Commissioning an artist to create a recognizable logo for polyproto ($200-400)</li>
<li>Commissioning a frontend developer to build a landing page for our project, since
non-developers do seem to prefer information hosted outside of GitHub and plain looking
documentation pages. This landing page would also host the written material mentioned in 1.
($500-1500)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Paying (freelance) developers to expedite this projects&#x27; journey to completion, where there are
the following tasks we could use additional brains on:
<ul>
<li>Paying developers to start integrating our polyproto crate into our &quot;chorus&quot; client library
and &quot;symfonia&quot; server (~$2000)</li>
<li>Stabilizing and extending the symfonia server to host a first, publicly usable instance
(~$1500)</li>
<li>Getting additional help from UI/UX designers and frontend developers to build a client mockup,
then having this mockup translated into a client prototype which can be hosted alongside the
symfonia server (~$2000)</li>
<li>&quot;Overhaul&quot;/Refactoring tasks which we, as a group of mainly university students working part
time jobs in addition, simply did not yet have the time to get to (~$1000-1500)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This would total to
$7700 or $9700, depending on whether the lower or higher estimate is used.
Additionally, I would like to extend the domains polyphony.chat and polyproto.org for some years using the funding and top up our prepaid E-Mail
server hosted at <a href="https://uberspace.de/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uberspace</a>. The domain and the E-Mail server make up most of our current operating costs, ranging between 7-12$
a month. This might not sound like a lot in the grand scheme of things, but I am currently paying
for these out of my own pocket as an undergraduate with little income, so being able to potentially
reduce monthly expenses is a nice prospect.</p>

<p>Already previously mentioned, Spacebar Chat is also working on an open-source Discord replacement in
form of offering an API-compatible server. However, they do not seem interested in making Spacebar
Chat a federated chat application with good user experience, as their primary focus is to
reverse-engineer and re-implement the Discord API spec-for-spec.</p>
<p>From talking to Spacebar Maintainers, their code reportedly seems to have accrued noticeable amounts
of technical debt which made it undesirable for most of the maintainers to continue development on
the server. Being friends with some of the now mostly inactive maintainers, I have considered
forking the server repository to have an already mostly working starting ground to work with.
However, due to the reports of technical debt and our organizations&#x27; unfamiliarity with
JavaScript/TypeScript, we have decided to start from scratch, in Rust.</p>
<p>The accumulated knowledge that Spacebar contributors and maintainers have collected in form of
documentation has already been of great use for our project, and we are contributing back by
updating documentation and creating issues, when we find disparities between the behaviours of our
own server implementation and their server implementation.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="xmpp">XMPP<a href="#xmpp" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to XMPP" title="Direct link to XMPP">​</a></h3>
<p>Much like XMPP, I have decided to make polyproto an extensible protocol.</p>
<p>I am of the opinion that XMPPs biggest downfall is how many extensions there are, and that a server
aiming to be compatible with other implementations of XMPP-based chat services should aim to
implement all of the XEPs to be a viable choice.</p>
<p>polyproto is actively trying to circumvent this by limiting polyproto extensions (P2 extensions for
short) to</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>either be a <strong>set</strong> of APIs and behaviours, defining a generic(!) version of a service. A
&quot;service&quot; is, for example, a chat application, a microblogging application or an image blogging
application. Service extensions should be the core functionality that is universally needed to
make an application function. In the case of a chat application, that might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Defining message group size granularity: Direct messages, Group messages, Guild-based messages</li>
<li>Defining what a room looks like</li>
<li>Defining the APIs and behaviours required to send and receive messages</li>
<li>Defining the APIs and behaviours required to perform commonly sought after things, such as
reacting to a message with an emoji</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal is that all different polyproto-based chat applications should then implement this
shared behaviour. Of course, developers may absolutely add their own behaviours and
functionality which is perhaps exclusive to their specific implementation. Core functionality
remains commonly defined however, which should make all polyproto-based chat applications
interoperable in these defined, common behaviours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>or describe a <strong>major</strong> technological addition, which can be used in the &quot;requires&quot; section of
another P2 extension. This &quot;requires&quot; section can be thought of like the dependency list of a
software package.</p>
<p>Technological additions might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Defining APIs and behaviours needed to implement the MLS (Messaging Layer Security) Protocol</li>
<li>Defining APIs and behaviours needed to establish and maintain a WebSocket connection, and how
to send/receive messages over this WebSocket connection.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By using clay-brick-sized building blocks instead of more LEGO-sized building blocks like XMPP does,
we hope to mitigate this problem that we perceive, while still offering an extensible yet
well-defined platform to build on.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="matrixelement">Matrix/Element<a href="#matrixelement" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Matrix/Element" title="Direct link to Matrix/Element">​</a></h3>
<p>Matrix is perhaps the closest we have yet gotten to federated chat software aimed towards a general
audience. However, as a strong believer in user experience - especially how first impressions impact
new, non-technical users, I believe that Matrix falls flat in this regard. A lot of peoples first
experience with Matrix is the infamous &quot;Could not decrypt: The senders device has not yet sent us
the keys for this message&quot;. The protocol and its sub-protocols are vast and complicated and use
bespoke cryptography protocol implementations such as Olm and Megolm, which, in the past, has
already been the cause of high-caliber vulnerabilities (see:
<a href="https://nebuchadnezzar-megolm.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nebuchadnezzar</a> and, more recently,
<a href="https://soatok.blog/2024/08/14/security-issues-in-matrixs-olm-library/#addendum-2024-08-14" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Soatok&#x27;s blog post</a>).</p>
<p>Matrix is truly impressive from a technical standpoint. Its extremely low centralized architecture
fills a niche which especially people already interested in technology seem to enjoy. However, this
invariably results in the fact that user experience has to be compromised. It is of my opinion that
while Matrix is relatively good at what it is doing, it is not a good fit to be a potential Discord
replacement.</p>
<p>As for a comparison: We are taking a radically different approach to Matrix. Matrix aims for
eventually-consistent federation of events using cryptographically fully verifiable directed acyclic
event graphs, where as polyproto, and by extension Polyphony, prioritize usability above all,
intentionally disregarding highly complex or novel data structures in favor of cryptographic
verifiability through digital signatures and simple public key infrastructure.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-are-significant-technical-challenges-you-expect-to-solve-during-the-project-if-any">What are significant technical challenges you expect to solve during the project, if any?<a href="#what-are-significant-technical-challenges-you-expect-to-solve-during-the-project-if-any" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What are significant technical challenges you expect to solve during the project, if any?" title="Direct link to What are significant technical challenges you expect to solve during the project, if any?">​</a></h2>
<p>Currently, our trust model acknowledges, that a users home server is able to create sessions and
session tokens on the users&#x27; behalf, and is thus able to listen in on unencrypted communications,
or, in the case of a truly malicious admin, would even be able to send messages on behalf of the
user. This is not a novel problem, as it also affects all Mastodon ActivityPub servers in existence.
Given that this potential abuse risk has not been a large issue in the Fediverse, we expect this to
also not be a major problem. However, I would like to find additional mitigations or even a solution
for this problem during further development of polyproto.</p>
<p>Another area that will likely need more work is my current design for how to connect to multiple
servers at once: Currently, I expect every client to hold a WebSocket connection with each server
that they are communicating with, at once. Depending on the amount of traffic, this could lead to
constantly high resource consumption for clients. If this turns out to be the case, I am sure that
we can find plenty of software- and protocol-side adjustments and improvements to implement - though
it is still a potential technical challenge.</p>
<p>My last major area of concern is how well transmission and de-/serializing of the X.509 based
Identity Certificates will work. I am optimistic about this however, since the X.500 series of RFCs
are extremely well documented and already deeply explored, so that even if challenges arise in this
area, I am certain that there is enough literature on the exact problem we might be facing, and
enough people to ask/talk to.</p>

<p>As the commercialization of Discord.com steadily increases, it is becoming clear that people are
looking for a usable alternative. This is an audience that we are hoping to capture. Our Polyphony
Chat service is Discord API compatible, so that actors may use the Polyphony client to interact with
both Discord.com and polyproto-chat-based instances, and that existing bots and automations could
potentially be ported over very easily. This essentially gives people looking for a Discord
replacement exactly what they are looking for, as there should be little to no additional concepts,
behaviors or patterns that users have to learn or re-learn to use our service.</p>
<p>As previously touched on, we are blessed to already have made a great amount of connections to
like-minded developers also working on similar projects, who are looking optimistically towards
polyproto as the tool to use to federate. I also have received explicit permission from Spacebar
Maintainers to promote our projects on their Discord Guild, which currently counts 3600 members.</p></div></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy"><a href="/blog/2024/06/01/extensions">polyproto extensions</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-06-01T00:00:00.000Z">June 1, 2024</time> · <!-- -->6 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_lV9A"><div class="avatar__name"><span class="authorName_yefp">bitfl0wer</span></div><div class="authorSocials_rSDt"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>polyproto is a new federation protocol.

<p>If any application wants to participate in the network of polyproto services, it has to speak the
same language as those other services. When wanting to send a message to a server that you are
authenticated on, your client needs to know exactly what that HTTP request has to look like. This is
nothing new. One take on a solution for this problem stems from the people working on the
ATProtocol, who created <a href="https://atproto.com/guides/lexicon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lexicon</a>. From the atproto website:</p>
<p>:::quote &quot;Lexicon TL;DR&quot;</p>
<div class="language-text codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">Lexicon is a global schema system.

The</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">definitions are JSON documents, similar to JSON-Schema. It&#x27;s currently used for HTTP endpoints,</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">event streams, and repo records</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>The core of polyproto is supposed to be infinitely adaptable, to be flexible enough to be used for
just about anything, which is why I do not want to force a fixed set of routes onto every single
polyproto implementation.</p>
<p>Lexicon sounds interesting and really versatile! However, as mature as the idea itself might be, it
is pretty complex and does not yet seem to have good community support in the form of
libraries/crates to aid in working with this new schema system. I also do not want to force
polyproto integrations to use a (potentially very complex) Lexicon parser and dynamic routing system
thingymajig - although having &quot;no rules&quot; means, that if you <em>want</em> to build a polyproto service
which uses Lexicon, you absolutely can.</p>

<p>I am a big proponent of defining a set of (mutually independent) protocol extensions, which include
additionally needed behavior and concrete HTTP routes for building a specific application. This has
the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you&#x27;d like to build a polyproto chat client, and there&#x27;s a polyproto-chat extension, you simply
need to add the additional things required by that extension. No need for complex parsing! Code
only what you need and do not care about the rest.</li>
<li>Mutual independence means being able to combine extensions however you&#x27;d like. You could, for
example, create a chat app with integrated microblogging functionality.</li>
<li>Developers are free to come up with whatever they want. How about ActivityPub x polyproto? Since
polyproto doesn&#x27;t define a message format, this is absolutely possible!</li>
<li>Simplicity! polyproto and its &quot;official&quot; extensions will always just have plain old REST APIs, for
which tooling is readily available. Why bother with something fancy and dynamic, when this does
the trick?</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, everyone now has to agree on one extension to use for a specific application. You
cannot participate on servers, which have use an extension which is completely different from the
one that your client implements, as an example.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-polyproto-foundation-get-it-sigh">...the <em>polyproto</em> foundation. Get it? <em>sigh</em><a href="#the-polyproto-foundation-get-it-sigh" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to the-polyproto-foundation-get-it-sigh" title="Direct link to the-polyproto-foundation-get-it-sigh">​</a></h2>
<p>To develop, provide and maintain polyproto and some major &quot;official&quot; extensions (such as
polyproto-chat), creating a non-profit foundation is likely a good idea for a future where polyproto
is actually being used in the real world.</p>
<p>This could sort of be seen like the XMPP Standards Foundation which develops and maintains XMPP
extensions. Unlike XMPPs extensions however, official polyproto extensions should always be <em>major</em>
additions in functionality. As an example: <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0084.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XEP-0084</a> is
the official XMPP extension for User Avatars. An entire 12 point document, which describes one
simple feature!</p>
<p>polyproto extensions should either always be a major technological addition, which can be taken
advantage of by other extensions (examples for this would be WebSocket Gateways and Messaging Layer
Security), or a document describing a <strong>set</strong> of routes, which define a particular application use
case (A Discord-like, a Reddit-like, a Twitter-like, and so on). Having official extensions adhere
to these rules ensures that polyproto will not become a cluttered mess of extensions and that it and
its extensions are easy to understand and implement, due to less documentation having to be read and
written.</p>

be treated as clients with a reduced feature set in this case. What is crucial, however, is that the
additional features do not prohibit &quot;reduced feature set clients&quot; from using the behavior described
in the extension, if any sort of federation or interoperability is wanted.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-tip admonition_xJq3 alert alert--success"><div class="admonitionHeading_Gvgb"><span class="admonitionIcon_Rf37"><svg viewBox="0 0 12 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.5 0C3.48 0 1 2.19 1 5c0 .92.55 2.25 1 3 1.34 2.25 1.78 2.78 2 4v1h5v-1c.22-1.22.66-1.75 2-4 .45-.75 1-2.08 1-3 0-2.81-2.48-5-5.5-5zm3.64 7.48c-.25.44-.47.8-.67 1.11-.86 1.41-1.25 2.06-1.45 3.23-.02.05-.02.11-.02.17H5c0-.06 0-.13-.02-.17-.2-1.17-.59-1.83-1.45-3.23-.2-.31-.42-.67-.67-1.11C2.44 6.78 2 5.65 2 5c0-2.2 2.02-4 4.5-4 1.22 0 2.36.42 3.22 1.19C10.55 2.94 11 3.94 11 5c0 .66-.44 1.78-.86 2.48zM4 14h5c-.23 1.14-1.3 2-2.5 2s-2.27-.86-2.5-2z"></path></svg></span>Example: What works</div><div class="admonitionContent_BuS1"><div class="language-text codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">In your implementation of a chat service, users can send each other messages with special</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">effects, such as fireworks, confetti and similar.

<p>The polyproto crate can now be used to create very basic - but to the best of my knowledge fully RFC
compliant - Certificate Signing Requests! This is cool, because Certificate Signing Requests are how
all Actors (Users) in polyproto will request a Certificate from their home server. The generated
CSRs can be fully verified using the OpenSSL/LibreSSL CLIs, which is very important, as these two
applications are the industry standard when it comes to working with cryptographic standards like
X.509.</p>
<p>Specifically, polyproto uses the well-defined
<a href="http://www.pkiglobe.org/pkcs10.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PKCS #10 standard</a> to pack up and transport all the needed CSR
information to your future home server.</p>
<p>The next steps here are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating validators for the information supplied in the CSRs</li>
<li>Implementing methods to create an ID-Cert from a CSR</li>
<li>Write great documentation for what exactly the data inside of the ID-CSR has to look like to be
valid</li>
</ul>
<p>...and as you might have already guessed, I am already working on all of these things! :) They just

<p>As fun as designing APIs and software architecture is for me, I don&#x27;t yet always get all of it right
on the first try. This is fine though, as long as you recognize the mistakes you&#x27;ve made, learn from
them and clean the mess you&#x27;ve made.</p>
<p>I noticed that, as well-meant as some of the traits and trait bounds I&#x27;ve added, they made
implementing polyprotos&#x27; base types and traits a lot harder than needed. I&#x27;ve been chipping away at
the unnecessary and redundant bits, removing some of these traits entirely.</p>

<p>I really wanted to get started on a reference polyproto implementation <em>before</em> finishing the
specification document. This might seem a little counter intuitive, but my thought process was, that
implementing the crate in code would force me to think about everything from scratch again, which
would make it much easier to spot mistakes I potentially made when writing the specification
documentation. These mistakes would primarily be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information that is there, but unimportant</li>
<li>Information that is important, but not there</li>
<li>Information that is important, there, but wrong</li>
</ul>
<p>This turned out to be right. I have added a lot of &quot;TODO&quot;s and &quot;FIXME&quot;s into the specification
document since started working on the polyproto crate. All of these TODOs have since been worked on
and removed! This doesn&#x27;t mean that the specification document is now perfect, but it&#x27;s already
better than before, and it&#x27;ll only get better as I continue to work on the crate!</p>
<p>Another, notable thing that happened is <em>removing the auth-part from the core polyproto protocol</em>!
You might be thinking &quot;whaaaat? does that mean that there will be no authentication in polyproto??&quot;
but I can assure you, that that&#x27;s not what this means. Removing the authentication endpoints from
the core protocol means that polyproto extensions can now choose authentication technologies and
methods for themselves, instead of being forced to implement a bunch of REST-based authentication
endpoints they might not even want or use anyways.</p>
<p>I would like to thank <code>@laxla@tech.lgbt</code> for this idea! :&gt; Collaboration and feedback are truly
great things, and I am happy to have such a nice group of people on Discord and Matrix who are
genuinely interested in the silly thing I/we want to do with Polyphony and polyproto :)</p>

so cool, and means that this is the project I have worked on the longest for, out of all of my
personal projects.</p>

medication which already does a good job (most of the time) at taking the edge off the depression.</p><p>As it has been explained to me by my therapist, medication should only be a crutch, though. It
should not be the tool you should solely rely on for the rest of your life to deal with extreme
(social) anxiety and depression. Other, non-medication-related options should be tried, to
potentially get you to stop having to take medication to feel
non-completely-absolutely-positively-awful every day.</p><p>One of these options is therapy, and, as I&#x27;ve mentioned, I&#x27;ve already been doing that for 2+ years
now. It has helped me a great, great deal already, and I can absolutely encourage anyone reading who
is feeling similarly to how I&#x27;ve described and who is in the lucky position to get (or at least be
put on a waiting list for) therapy, to take the first step. It isn&#x27;t easy; it can actually feel
really really scary at first. But do believe me when I say that a good therapist can absolutely help
you to get better.</p><p>But one hour of therapy a week can sadly only do <em>so</em> much. This is why I, with the encouragement of
my friends, loved ones (particularly my lovely, lovely girlfriend) and my therapist, have decided to
admit myself into a mental health clinic that specializes in the treatment of depression, anxiety
disorders and the like.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-tip admonition_xJq3 alert alert--success"><div class="admonitionHeading_Gvgb"><span class="admonitionIcon_Rf37"><svg viewBox="0 0 12 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.5 0C3.48 0 1 2.19 1 5c0 .92.55 2.25 1 3 1.34 2.25 1.78 2.78 2 4v1h5v-1c.22-1.22.66-1.75 2-4 .45-.75 1-2.08 1-3 0-2.81-2.48-5-5.5-5zm3.64 7.48c-.25.44-.47.8-.67 1.11-.86 1.41-1.25 2.06-1.45 3.23-.02.05-.02.11-.02.17H5c0-.06 0-.13-.02-.17-.2-1.17-.59-1.83-1.45-3.23-.2-.31-.42-.67-.67-1.11C2.44 6.78 2 5.65 2 5c0-2.2 2.02-4 4.5-4 1.22 0 2.36.42 3.22 1.19C10.55 2.94 11 3.94 11 5c0 .66-.44 1.78-.86 2.48zM4 14h5c-.23 1.14-1.3 2-2.5 2s-2.27-.86-2.5-2z"></path></svg></span>Safety checkpoint reached!</div><div class="admonitionContent_BuS1"><div class="language-text codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">It&#x27;s now over! :)</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div></div></div></div></div>
<p>Starting on March 20th, I will be leaving my everyday life, my girlfriend, my friends, laptop, work,
personal projects and everything else behind to go there, and hopefully leave a good bad part of me
behind when I come back.</p>
<p>The clinic is far away though, and leaving absolutely everything behind for a month or possibly a
little longer is really, really scary to me. However, I think and hope that the metaphorical plunge
into icy water will be worth it for me and my mental health.</p>
<p>When I come back, I&#x27;ll be better than I was before, which will also mean that I can hopefully be
more happy and productive in all aspects of my life, including Polyphony.</p>
<p>If you&#x27;re reading this on or after March 20th, then see you on the other side :) I hope the grass is
greener there!</p>

<p>polyproto is a federation protocol that uses X.509 Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to prove and
federate your identity across a whole network of decentralized services.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="x509">X.509<a href="#x509" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to X.509" title="Direct link to X.509">​</a></h2>
<p>Specifically, polyproto leverages the already well-documented and widely used X.509 standard at its
core. X.509 was chosen over <code>OpenPGP</code> because of its comparative simplicity. The Web of Trust from
<code>OpenPGP</code> often requires active user input to assign trust levels to users and their keys, which is
not inline with our ideas and goals for user experience in a decentralized system. Ideally,
decentralization and federation is as seamless as possible for the end-user, and X.509 with its
Certificate Authority (CA for short) model is the better fit for such a goal. In fact, X.509 can be
<em>so</em> seamless to the end-user, that you have probably forgotten that you are already using it right
now!</p>
<p>HTTPS (SSL/TLS) certificates are likely the most popular form of digital certificate out there, and
they&#x27;re implemented in a way, where the only time us humans ever have to think about them, is when
our browser tells us that a certificate from a website we&#x27;re trying to visit, is not valid anymore.</p>
<p>This popularity is great news for polyproto, because it means that mature tooling for all sorts of
programming languages exists <em>today</em>, along with tutorials and documentation, teaching potential
implementers how everything works.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-polyproto-uses-x509-briefly">How polyproto uses X.509, briefly<a href="#how-polyproto-uses-x509-briefly" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How polyproto uses X.509, briefly" title="Direct link to How polyproto uses X.509, briefly">​</a></h2>
<p>In polyproto, home servers act as Certificate Authorities, while each client you connect from has
its own end-user Certificate, issued by your home server. With certificates, you can prove your
identity to any person or server at any time. Certificates are also used to verify the integrity of
data sent across the polyproto network.</p>
<p>If servers and clients have well-implemented cryptography, it should be <em>extremely</em> unlikely - if
not impossible - for non-quantum-based, non-supercomputer-cluster home servers to alter the contents
of a message before passing them on to the recipient.</p>

<p>In short, clients generate a <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2986" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PKCS #10</a> Certificate
Signing Request (CSR). This CSR includes some information about the client. In polyprotos case, this
information is:</p>
<ul>
<li>session ID</li>
<li>federation ID</li>
<li>algorithm used to generate the public key attached to the CSR</li>
<li>the public key attached to the CSR</li>
<li>a signature which is verifiable using the attached public key, validating all of the
aforementioned information</li>
</ul>
<p>This CSR is sent to your home server, which verifies this information and in turn responds with a
polyproto X.509 Certificate (ID-Cert).</p>
<p>Home servers get their root certificate by self-signing a CSR. Unlike actor/client certificates, the
home server root certificate features
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509#Extensions_informing_a_specific_usage_of_a_certificate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X.509 extensions such as the &quot;Basic Constraints&quot; attribute</a>,
marking its certificate as a CA certificate, allowing the home server to sign CSRs using this
certificate.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="but-its-not-all-perfect">But it&#x27;s not all perfect<a href="#but-its-not-all-perfect" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to But it&#x27;s not all perfect" title="Direct link to But it&#x27;s not all perfect">​</a></h2>
<p>Root Certificates in the context of HTTPS and the modern, SSL/TLS protected web are a big source of
centralization. This centralization might be necessary to a degree, but it inevitably means less
plurality, and way more hoops to jump through, should you also want to be a CA.</p>
<p>To give context for those who might need it, essentially, every certificate for every website out
there has to be able to be traced back to one of the root certificates installed on your
internet-capable device&#x27;s operating system or web browser. This creates an incredible amount of
centralization, because one Root Certificate Authority is directly responsible for hundreds of
thousands, if not millions of websites. This dependency on a few privileged Root CAs has been
monetized, which is why getting an SSL/TLS certificate for your website used to cost you money (and
depending on who you are, it might still be that way). Nowadays though,
<a href="https://letsencrypt.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Let&#x27;s Encrypt</a> exists, offering free SSL/TLS certificates, with the caveat
that these certificates are only valid for three months at a time.</p>

<p>To try and keep open polyproto networks to <em>stay</em> open for everyone, polyproto should make
centralization to the degree of modern-day SSL/TLS at infeasible.</p>
<p>An approach we are taking is limiting the length of the certification path.</p>
<p>In X.509, to validate and trust a certificate, you must also trust all the other certificates
leading up to the Root Certificate of the Certificate Tree.</p>

In this
blog post, I will outline how I imagine account migration to work in polyproto, and what benefits
this approach brings.</p>
<p>{/_ truncate _/}</p>
<p>It seems that striking a good balance between user experience, convenience and privacy has been a
difficult task for many federated systems, when it comes to account migration. polyprotos&#x27; approach
to how data is distributed and stored, and how identities are managed, makes it possible to have a
very smooth and secure account migration process.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-problem">The problem<a href="#the-problem" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The problem" title="Direct link to The problem">​</a></h2>
<p>Using Mastodon as an example; When a user wants to move from one instance to another, they have to
create a new account on the new instance, and follow all the people they were following on the old
account. All the toots and other data from the old account are left behind, and you do not have a
way of porting them over to the new account. This is a problem that has been around for a long time,
and it is not just a problem with Mastodon, but with many other federated systems as well.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-polyproto-works-briefly">How polyproto works, briefly<a href="#how-polyproto-works-briefly" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How polyproto works, briefly" title="Direct link to How polyproto works, briefly">​</a></h2>
<p>In polyproto, your federation ID, e.g. <code>xenia@example.com</code>, is what identifies you. If you want to
use this identity on a client, your client will generate a key pair for a certificate signing
request, and send this request to your home server. Given that you didn&#x27;t provide any invalid data,
your home server will sign the certificate, and send it back to you.</p>
<p>Any data you send to anyone - be it a chat message, a social media post, or anything else - is
signed using your private key. This signature can be verified by anyone using your public key, which
is part of the certificate you received from your home server. To check a certificates&#x27; validity,
you can ask the home server for its root certificate, and verify the signature on the certificate
you received.</p>
<p>This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>All the data you send is cryptographically tied to your identity</li>
<li>Anyone can verify that the data was actually sent by you</li>
<li>Anyone can verify that the data was not tampered with by anyone else</li>
<li>Everybody can verify that you are who you say you are</li>
</ul>
<p>This is even true when you are sending data to a different server than your home server.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, the process of migrating an account in polyproto relies mostly on changing data
ownership, rather than moving data around. This works best in scenarios where data is highly
distributed, and not stored in a central location.</p>

<p>Should data actually need to be moved, for example when the old server is going to be shut down, or
if the centralization of data is higher, the migration process is extended by a few steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using the old account, your client requests a data export from your old home server.</li>
<li>The old home server sends you a data export. Your client will check the signatures on the
exported data, to make sure that the data was not tampered with.</li>
<li>You then import the data into your new account on the new home server.</li>
<li></li>
</ol>

<p>polyproto&#x27;s approach to account migration is very user-friendly, and does not require the user to do
anything that is not already part of the normal usage of the system. The process is also very
secure, as it relies on the cryptographic properties of X.509 certificates, and also works across a
highly distributed data model, which, in my opinion, is how the internet <em>should</em> be.</p>
<p>The biggest drawback to this approach is that there are a whole lot of web requests involved.
Depending on the amount of data, this can take some minutes or possibly even hours.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that all of this does not require any new or young technology. polyproto
relies on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X.509 certificates</a>, which have been around for a
long time, and are widely used in many different applications. This means that the technology is
well understood, and that there are already many great tools in all sorts of programming languages
available to work with it. From my point of view, there is no need to reinvent the wheel.</p>

porting chorus to WebAssembly.</p>
<p>{/_ truncate _/}</p>
<p>Hi all!</p>
<p>To make this part of the post short: The web-based client will be worked on <em>before</em> the native one,
if there even ever will be one. The reason is that no currently available native Rust GUI library
meets the standards I&#x27;d like to see when using it to build an application I am putting my name
behind. I&#x27;d like to have</p>
<ul>
<li>accessibility</li>
<li>great styling</li>
<li>cross compilation</li>
<li>memory safety</li>
</ul>
<p>and the current state of Rust GUIs essentially tells me to &quot;pick three&quot;, which is unacceptable to
me. A WebAssembly based application is the best we&#x27;ll get for now, and I am fine with that.</p>
<p>Compiling to WebAssembly isn&#x27;t all that easy though: The <code>wasm32-unknown-unknown</code> target
intentionally makes no assumptions about the environment it is deployed in, and therefore does not
provide things like a <code>net</code> or <code>filesystem</code> implementation (amongst other things). Luckily, adding
support for this compilation target only took me a full 40h work week [:)], and we are now the first
Rust Discord-API library (that I know of) to support this target.</p>
<p>You might not have yet heard much about WebAssembly: In the past, web developers could only really
use three languages - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - to write code that browsers could understand
directly. With WebAssembly, developers can write code in many other languages, then use WASM to
convert it into a form the browser can run.</p>
<p>This is particularly helpful for programs that require a lot of computing power, like video games or
design software. Before, running such programs in a browser would be slow or impossible. WebAssembly
can make these run smoothly, right in your web browser.</p>
<p>Overall, WebAssembly is expanding the kinds of applications that can be run on the web, making the
web a more flexible and powerful place to work and play. Compiling Chorus for WASM allows us to
leverage this fairly new technology and bring all of Rusts benefits into a web context.</p>
<p>The next blog post will likely be about progress with the web-based client. See ya until then! :)</p></div></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy"><a href="/blog/2023/09/02/client-getting-started">Getting started with the Polyphony Client</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-09-02T00:00:00.000Z">September 2, 2023</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_lV9A"><div class="avatar__name"><span class="authorName_yefp">bitfl0wer</span></div><div class="authorSocials_rSDt"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>{/_ truncate _/}</p>
<p>Us labeling Chorus to be in a public-alpha state was really great news for me, for a lot of reasons!
It marked a point in Polyphonys history where, after all these months of work, we agreed upon the
fact that what we <em>have</em> is good enough to be shown to the public, and that&#x27;s always a nice thing
when investing so much of your free-time into a project. The other main reason why this is such a
great thing is, because this alpha state (at least to me) means, that the public API is kind-of
stable, or at least stable enough so that I, the project lead, can rely upon the fact that all the
public methods will not, in fact, be replaced in 4 days.</p>
<p>This means, that I can finally start working on the Client! And I have done that! For the past 2? 3?
Days, I&#x27;ve been tinkering around with Iced-rs (a really, really great UI framework for Rust, written
in Rust) and the client repository to create the &#x27;skeleton&#x27; of the application. While this is
definitely not trivial, especially since I have <em>no</em> prior experience in desktop application
development, it&#x27;s also not too hard either.</p>
<p>While Iced is not mature yet, and &quot;how-to&quot; guides, as well as the promised Iced-book, are still
largely missing, the maintainers have done a great job with providing a LOT of code examples and
solid rustdocs. It&#x27;s a fun library/framework to work with, and the Elm-inspired approach of dividing
up State, Messages, View- and Update-Logic feels really intuitive and seems to make sure that your
Application will never end up in an unexpected state.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s all I have for today. Thanks for reading this! Here&#x27;s a video of multi-user login already
working ^^</p>

As of 2 days ago, the first Alpha of Chorus, Version 0.1.0, has been released for
everyone to look at and use on crates.io!</p>
<p>{/_ truncate _/}</p>
<p>So, is the library complete now? No. And yes! It&#x27;s, well, complicated... Let me explain!</p>
<p>Chorus is at a point where I can comfortably say that, if you take voice-support out of the
calculation for a bit, the foundation feels rock-solid, easy to work with and easily expandable.
However, to stay with our house/building metaphor for a bit, the walls aren&#x27;t painted yet, there&#x27;s
barely any furniture and not all of the electrical outlets have been installed yet.</p>
<p>Okay, enough with this bad metaphor; What I meant to convey is, that a lot of the API endpoints have
not yet been implemented, and there are at least a few points we haven&#x27;t addressed yet - like
Gateway Error Handling, to name an example.</p>
<p>But for an early Alpha, this, in my opinion, is absolutely acceptable. Implementing API endpoints is
something that probably someone who is entirely new to Rust could do, given that we&#x27;ve streamlined
the procedure so much, and the other stuff can comfortably be fixed without having to do any major
changes to the internals.</p>
<p>I, for one, am currently experimenting around with the Polyphony Client, which, by the way, will
likely be written with Iced as a GUI Framework, not GTK. I have no prior experience in GUI/Desktop
Application development, but I am feeling more confident than ever and I&#x27;m eager to learn all there
is to know about these topics.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s that! Seeya next time. Cheers,</p>

<p>{/_ truncate _/}</p>
<p>It has been a while since the last update post - 1 month to be precise! I haven&#x27;t gotten around to
writing one of these, mostly because of personal time- and energy constraints. However, now that
these resources are finally replenishing again, I figured that it is once again time!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="moving-blog-posts-to-github">Moving Blog Posts to GitHub<a href="#moving-blog-posts-to-github" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Moving Blog Posts to GitHub" title="Direct link to Moving Blog Posts to GitHub">​</a></h2>
<p>This is a pretty self-explanatory point. I thought, that opencollective would find more use by me
and other polyphony-curious folk, however, this didn&#x27;t go as planned. Also, opencollective made
their Discord embeds really poopy, which is why I am moving all the blog posts over to GitHub.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-big-one-self-updating-structs">A big one: Self-updating structs<a href="#a-big-one-self-updating-structs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A big one: Self-updating structs" title="Direct link to A big one: Self-updating structs">​</a></h2>
<p>Ideally, you want entities like Channels, Guilds, or Users to react to Gateway events. A Gateway
event is basically a message from Spacebar/Discord to you, which says: &quot;Hey, User <code>x</code> has changed
their name to <code>y</code>!&quot;. If you can reflect those changes immediately within your code, you save
yourself from having to make a lot of requests and potentially getting rate-limited.</p>
<p>This is exactly what Self-updating structs set out to solve. The first implementation was done by
@SpecificProtagonist and me (thank you a lot again, btw) on the 21st of July. However: This
implementation, being in its&#x27; infancy, has had some design flaws, which to me made pretty clear,
that this whole thing needed to be thought through a little better.</p>
<p>The second iteration of these Self-updating structs was finished... today, actually, by me. It saves
memory compared to the first iteration by storing unique objects only once, instead of
<code>n = how many times they are being referenced</code>-times. While this way of doing things is really
efficient, it also has been a pain in the ass to make, which is precisely the reason why this took
me so long. I&#x27;ve learned a lot along the way though.</p>
<p>The public API has also gotten a <em>lot</em> better in &quot;v2&quot;. This is mostly because I am a big believer in
writing tests for your code, and through writing what are essentialy real-world-simulation-examples,
I noticed how repetitive or stupid some things were, and thus could improve upon them.</p>
<p>Having this whole thing finished is a big relief. This self-updating thing is an essential feature
for any Discord/Spacebar compatible library, and I think that we implemented it very nicely.</p>

<p>@kozabrada123 took it upon himself to re-write a lot of the codes&#x27; Documentation. Thanks for that!
This will massively improve the ease of use of this library - both when developing <em>for</em> and <em>with</em>
it. koza also improved our CI/CT pipeline by incorporating build-caching into it, which speeds up
builds.</p>
<p>This has been the last month of Polyphony. In the coming weeks, I will be working on</p>
<ul>
<li>Implementing self-updating-struct behavior for every struct which needs it</li>
<li>Fixing bugs</li>
<li>Adding more features, like emojis, 2FA, Guild Settings, etc.!</li>
